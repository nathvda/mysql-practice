Welcome to my repository, I am a junior web developer in training at Be/Code and I am currently learning about mysql. This repository will contain all my exercises about this matter and will be updated according to my exploration of the database and languages. It will include CRUD requests and more informations about updates will be provided in the following days. This repository was first started on January 20th 2023.
